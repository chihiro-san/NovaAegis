# NovaAegis
NovaAegis is an integrated cybersecurity platform designed to protect organizations from the rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape. Leveraging advanced
artificial intelligence, the platform proactively defends against both external attacks such
as AI-driven phishing, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and ransomware and internal
risks stemming from insider threats. NovaAegis combines several key components: an
AI-powered email filtering module that analyzes incoming emails and flags suspicious
content; a purpose-built honeypot that simulates a vulnerable bank web application to
capture real-world attack data; an AI attack analysis engine that classifies exploits and
generates targeted remediation recommendations; and an IAM module that displays
user-role assignments and account statuses for enhanced internal security monitoring.
All components are seamlessly integrated into a unified security dashboard and
containerized using Docker for scalability and ease of deployment. Through rigorous
testing and iterative development, NovaAegis demonstrates its ability to provide real-time
threat detection, rapid incident response, and actionable insights, thereby fortifying the
digital infrastructure of institutions. This platform not only addresses current
cybersecurity challenges but also establishes a foundation for continuous improvement
in the face of emerging threats.
